Codes are pretty amazing. It uses a lot of shorthanded codes that makes the flow more efficient. Usage of repository
code are well observed in the whole structure. What it makes is that codes will be reusable and properly distributed
for ease of review and reading. It was pretty ideal also in this scenario because of the usage of heavy conditions such
as on  `BookingRepository/store`.


But there are still room for improvement. For example, it could maximize the use of `Laravel Authentication` to
properly segregate 2 roles and ease of retrieving the authenticated user via request. Addition of `Form Validation` in
the entry point would be much helpful as it will check if the passed parameters met the strict format of the data to
perform the task correctly and to lessen the errors due to incorrect formats
